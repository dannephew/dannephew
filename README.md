## Hi, I'm Dani!
- ⚥ Pronouns: she/they
- 🌱 I'm currently applying to Counseling Psychology programs in Canada and USA
- 📚 I research sex-affirming, harm-reduction counseling—using mixed methods and human-centred design to improve access, retention, and outcomes for stigmatized communities
- 🧘🏻‍♀️ Fun fact: I spent the majority of 2024-2025 volunteering at Buddhist temples and meditations centers around India, China, Taiwan, Mexico, and Canada
